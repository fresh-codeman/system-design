we will learn about the high level and low level design. following are the few topics we will look for.

## high level system design

- [Load balancing](/high-level-design/load-balancing.md)
- [Caching](/high-level-design/caching.md)
- [cdn](/high-level-design/cdn.md)
- [Date partitioning](/high-level-design/data-partitioning.md)

## Low level system design

- [solid principle](/low-level-design/solid-princiiple.md)

### Design Patterns

- [Strategy design pattern](/low-level-design/strategy-design-pattern.md):- It allows you to define a family of algorithms
- [Observer design pattern](/low-level-design/obeserver-design-pattern.md)
